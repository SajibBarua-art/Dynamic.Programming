# Dynamic.Programming

I tried to write the dp algorithms in c++..If you face any problem to understand the code or notice any mistakes feel free to point out..
I didn't directly translated from tutors javascript code.. I understood the algorithm and imlemented in my own way.. So it won't be so effecient as tutors..
